Subject: Security Vulnerability Report: SelfRegV3 SSN Field Rendering Failure - HIGH Severity

Dear Chief Information Security Officer DeSain,

I am writing to report a critical security vulnerability in the NY.gov ID Self Registration system (SelfRegV3) that is currently blocking all new user registrations.

## Summary

The SSN input field on the registration form (selfregsteptwo.xhtml) fails to render, causing 100% of identity verification attempts to fail. Users receive a generic "identity could not be verified" error with no indication of the actual technical failure.

## Affected System

- URL: https://my.ny.gov/SelfRegV3/selfregsteptwo.xhtml
- Build: 12/05/2025 9:11 PM W: (NULL) A: 169PB_1
- Framework: JSF/PrimeFaces

## Technical Details

The DOM contains an empty SSN panel:
```html
<span id="selfregform:ssnPanel"></span>  <!-- Should contain SSN input -->
```

The page loads jquery.maskssn.js expecting to find .ssnId elements, but none exist because the server-side component fails to render.

## Impact

- All new NY.gov ID registrations are blocked
- Users cannot access services requiring NY.gov authentication
- Healthcare enrollment, DMV services, and other critical state services are inaccessible to new users

## Proof of Concept

I have documented a client-side workaround that injects the missing field and allows registration to complete:

## Related Issue

I also discovered that the ITS FOIL portal (itsny.govqa.us) has a similar rendering bug where the BotDetect CAPTCHA displays with 0x0 dimensions:

- FOIL Reference: R000252-010326

## Offer of Assistance

I am available to provide additional technical details, logs, or screen recordings to assist your team in resolving this issue. I am also prepared to offer pro bono assistance with remediation if helpful.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Given the impact on public access to state services, I hope this can be addressed promptly.
